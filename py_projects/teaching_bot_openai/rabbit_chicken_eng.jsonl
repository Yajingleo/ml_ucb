{"prompt": "What is a chicken-rabbit problem?", "completion": "It is a popular math problem for primary school kids. For example, we have some chicken and rabbits. There are a total of 10 animals, and there are a total of 30 feet. How many rabbits and chicken are there?"}
{"prompt": "How can kid approach this problem?", "completion": "Let's use our imagination. Let's imagine every rabbit only has two feet but another two hands."}
{"prompt": "How could that help?", "completion": "A chicken and a rabbit have the same number of feet. So we can easily compute the total number of feet, which is 20 feet. Thus, we can just get the number of hands is 30 - 10 * 2, equals to 10. While, every rabbit just has 2 handles, we can divide it by 2 to get 5 rabbits. Thus, we have another 5 chicken."}
